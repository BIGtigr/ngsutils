    basecall      - Base caller

  RNA-seq
    count         - Calculates counts/RPKM for genes/BED regions/repeats

  General
    convertregion - Converts region mapping to genomic mapping
    export        - Export reads, mapped positions, and other tags
    expressed     - Finds regions expressed in a BAM file
    extract       - Extracts reads based on regions in a BED file
    filter        - Removes reads from a BAM file based on criteria
    merge         - Combine multiple BAM files together (taking best-matches)
    renamepair    - Postprocesses a BAM file to rename pairs that have an extra /N value
    split         - Splits a BAM file into smaller pieces
    stats         - Calculates simple stats for a BAM file
    tag           - Update read names with a suffix (for merging)

  Conversion
    tobed         - Convert BAM reads to BED regions
    tobedgraph    - Convert BAM coverage to bedGraph (for visualization)
    tofasta       - Convert BAM reads to FASTA sequences
    tofastq       - Convert BAM reads back to FASTQ sequences

  Misc
    check         - Checks a BAM file for corruption
    cleancigar    - Fixes BAM files where the CIGAR alignment has a zero length element
